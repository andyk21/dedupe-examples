# dedupe-examples

## What is this?

These two examples are applications of [Dedupe](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe), based off of this [repository](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe-examples/tree/master/pgsql_big_dedupe_example).

## How do I run this?

Set up a local Postgres DB.
Make sure to run the `.ipynb` files suffixed with '-data' first, as those are needed to preprocess the data. All data is included in the repository.
